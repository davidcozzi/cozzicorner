            While preparing for the launch of &#1046; COZZI, I found myself wanting a place where I could write about my developer journey. 
            There are countless options to chose from. Everyone recommends the overly robust and complicated Wordpress, while some prefer the minimalistic Ghost.
            These options, while appropriate for their own use cases felt overwhelming for such simple blog. Inspired by the minimalistic, out of the way 
            design of Seth Godin's blog, I knew that I wanted something similar, however, none of the major platforms seem to offer themes in this style and performance.
            If I wanted it, I would have to build it, and even if it fails, I could blog about the experience, so here I am.

            From my years of prior Wordpress experience, I knew that fundamentally there are two classes of data in a blog: images and text. Images, obviously,
            are significant in size, but text blocks are not. As a result, I could put all of my posts into a single JSON file - blog.json, with the images seperated into
            an uploads folder. This would make the feed rather performant as the single file would be cached between pages and the initial page load would not be
            burdened by the loading of images on the first paint. 
        </p>

            At first, I structured the JSON file with the blog components: title, subtitle, body, and publication date.
            While easy to parse, display, and maintain, it was extremely rigid and plain. If I wanted to have a blogging platform that adapted to my needs, I would have to
            allow the platform to spread its wings. I decided on having full HTML support inside of posts, with a small set of primitives to keep the blogs consistent.
            The "platform" would then simply display the HTML as it was written to the JSON file. There's one catch: HTML's syntax is incompatible with JSON with its use of
            quotations. I will admit, its a crutch, any time I run into these problems I instantly turn to Base64 encoding. Before inserting into the JSON file, I encode
            by posts, preserving the post's struture without modification. Additionally, since I have "full" HTML, I can add awesome WebXR experiences directly into the posts!
            The last feature I needed was search. Using Fuse.js was easy, and pretty performant for the dataset. While I only get title based search due to the encoding of the posts,
            it is sufficient for users to find articles easily and quickly.

            Overall, while it may have taken an extra hour (if that) to make my own blog from scratch, it was definitely worth it. I look forward to regularly updating this site
            with future developments as I continue to create the future of web-based hyperreality. If you're interested in keeping up with my developments, add a bookmark. It would be greatly appreciated.

            P.S. If you want to review how this site works in depth, I decided to keep the code unminified for your interest.
